Specifically, the process involved extracting the year of your application, which was identified as 2023, and your start year, which was found to be 2022. The classification rule stated that if the start year is greater than the application year minus two years (in this case, 2021), it would be classified as 'recently hired.' Since your start year of 2022 meets this condition, the system categorized your employment accordingly.Additionally, because your start date was after January 1, 2022, the process indicated that self-employment income cannot be used for qualification, as it does not represent a full 12 months of income from the current business. This decision reaffirms the classification of your employment tenure as 'recently hired.'"

If any of these forms are missing, a message indicating that the required documentation is not present is generated.For scenario 2, the validation similarly checks for the same forms but allows for either the most recent tax year or the prior two years, provided other conditions are met, such as having the necessary IRS extensions.Finally, in scenario 1, the same tax forms are again required, following similar conditions about their presence.Since the workflow specifies that the presence of these forms is crucial and directly affects the validation status, understanding the specific scenario relevant to your case will determine the outcome of your validation process.

From this document, key financial figures are extracted, including net profit or loss, business miles, and other relevant income and expenses.3. **Assign Mileage Rate**: Based on the extracted tax year, a mileage rate is assigned according to a predefined list.4. **Calculate Vehicle Depreciation**: The vehicle depreciation is calculated using the mileage rate applied to the business miles.5. **Prior Year Monthly Average Calculation**: A monthly average is determined from the previous year's financials by factoring in various income and expense components.6. **Compare Monthly Averages**: The process then compares the prior year’s average with the latest monthly average for the current tax year to assess growth or decline.7. **Monthly Income Calculation**: Depending on the comparison results, a monthly income value is calculated.8. **Validate Income Trend**: Finally, the income trend is validated against specific thresholds, and a descriptive message is generated about the income trend, indicating whether it reflects growth, stability, or decline.This method ensures a comprehensive analysis of your business cash flow trend based on historical data and calculated metrics."

However, no tax form was found for that year.Mileage Rate Assignment: Since the required tax form for 2021 could not be retrieved, the mileage rate assignment based on the tax year didn't occur, which is essential for calculating vehicle depreciation.Vehicle Depreciation Calculation: The inability to retrieve business miles (which was recorded as None) prevented the vehicle depreciation calculation from being executed properly. Monthly Average Calculation: The process attempts to compute the prior year monthly average, but faced challenges because of missing information from the previous steps.Comparison and Income Calculation: The process then moves on to compare the monthly averages, but due to the absence of the necessary data, it encountered validation issues with both the tax year monthly average and comparison percentage.Ultimately, the absence of required tax documentation and valid numeric inputs led to an incomplete cash flow trend analysis, causing the calculations to halt without reaching a conclusion."

According to the process, if an application date is between 04/15 and 10/14 of the current year, it is categorized as Scenario 2.This categorization affects the process primarily during the validation of required tax forms. In your case, after determining that your application scenario is 2, the system checks for the presence of necessary tax forms from the previous two years (2021 and 2022). The validation found that while your personal tax return (Form 1040) was available for both years, the required business tax returns (Form 1120S and Form 1120SSCHK1) were missing. As a result, the overall documentation did not meet the necessary requirements for proceeding with the application.In summary, being classified as 'mid year' triggered a specific validation process that ultimately identified missing documentation, halting the further processing of your application."

Initially, the validation step attempted to extract the application year from the provided application date, successfully determining it to be 2022. However, it calculated the target tax year as 2021. During the extraction of tax forms for the year 2021, it found no relevant tax forms. Consequently, when the process tried to assign a mileage rate based on the tax year, it was unable to do so since the tax year was not valid or available.Because there was no valid input for business miles, the computation for vehicle depreciation could not proceed, resulting in an invalid input error. This lack of necessary information led to further failures in calculating averages and validating income trends, as subsequent steps expected numerical values for comparisons that could not be computed.In summary, the absence of the required tax form for the year 2021 and the subsequent lack of valid data for business miles caused the calculations for mileage and depreciation to fail."

            "response":"The 'htp_schedule_c_validation' applies a logical sequence to verify your business earnings through several crucial stages:Monthly Income Calculation: If the comparison_percentage (which compares current income to previous periods) is greater than or equal to 0, it calculates the monthly_income as the average of tax_year_monthly_avg and prior_year_monthly_avg. If the comparison_percentage is negative, it assigns monthly_income solely from tax_year_monthly_avg.Income Trend Validation: The next step involves evaluating the income trend using the comparison_percentage. Depending on its value, various messages are triggered:A rise over 30 percent suggests significant growth, necessitating further verification for sustainability.An increase up to 30% indicates stable growth.A decrease up to 30 percent raises concerns about potential temporary challenges.A decline exceeding 30% may point to financial instability, prompting further documentation and analysis.Data Extraction: The process starts by identifying the relevant tax forms for the previous year. It attempts to extract necessary fields like business_miles, net_profit_or_loss, other income-related values, etc.In your case, however, it appears that there were issues retrieving the necessary tax form and associated financial data for the calculation. Specifically, the system couldn't find a tax form for the calculated target year (2021), leading to multiple errors regarding NoneType values and ensuring that required fields were present to compute your business earnings accurately."
